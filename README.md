# Deploy Humio with Ansible

The purpose of this repository is to serve as inspiration for how Humio can be deployed with Ansible, using our pre-built Ansible Galaxy roles

* [humio.java](https://galaxy.ansible.com/humio/java)
* [humio.kafka](https://galaxy.ansible.com/humio/kafka)
* [humio.server](https://galaxy.ansible.com/humio/server)

Bare in mind that *we take no responsibility for breaking changes* in the examples themselves. Therefor we strongly recommend you only use them as inspiration.

## Samples

We have divided this repository into a number of separate sample projects, mainly

* [Packet.net](packet_net)
* [AWS EC2](aws_ec2)
